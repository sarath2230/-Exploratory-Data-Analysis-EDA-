# Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Titanic Dataset

This task focuses on understanding the Titanic dataset using statistics and visualizations to uncover hidden patterns, relationships, and potential features for machine learning.

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed:

- Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std) for numerical and categorical features
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms, boxplots, and countplots
- Created pairplots and correlation heatmaps to analyze relationships between variables
- Explored survival patterns based on gender, class, age and fare
- ## 📈 Outcome:
This EDA revealed strong relationships between survival and features like gender, class, family size, and title. The dataset is now better understood and enriched with informative features, making it ready for model building in future tasks.
